Ray Tracer written in CUDA
====================================================================================================
The aim of this project is to implement a raytracer in CUDA.
The original inspiration was the _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ series of books now available to the public for free in PDF
form, along with the accompanying source code. Releases are available [directly from GitHub].
